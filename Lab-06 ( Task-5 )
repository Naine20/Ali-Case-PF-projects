/* Letâ€™s consider a seating arrangement in a theater. Imagine a theater with multiple rows of seats, where each row has several seats numbered from left to right. If we want to display the seat numbers in each row.
There are 5 rows and each row has 10 seats. A nested loop can help us print each seat's number in each row.
